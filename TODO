TODO and wishes for Frescobaldi 2.x
===================================


- LilyPond context help

- wizard to download and unpack LilyPond documentation and/or LilyPond itself

- Edit->Select Block

- Load .ly file specifying other encoding than UTF-8
  (this can be done from the command line but not via the user interface)

- interface for running lilypond-book

- Midi input and import. Probably using a basic sequencer, allowing changes,
  corrections and quantizing touchups before putting the LilyPond representation
  in the editor.

- tool to separate out things from music and attach them to invisible rests (s)
  in a separate expression

- check or even auto-insert bar checks

- editing via Music View:
  * relevant context menu on right-clicking object
  * drag an object to e.g. create an \override #'extra-offset command

- Table of Contents support in qpopplerview
  stub: qpopplerview/toc.py


Other ideas/wishes
==================


- continuous autocompile (run LilyPond whenever deemed suitable)
  stub: engrave/autocompile.py

- support for Git/Hg/Svn diff/revert/commit

- play from cursor: plays music to MIDI output

- editor:
    * context menu (with help, open filename, etc)
    * if matching brace out of view, popup a small display of it (idea:
      Franciso Vila)
    * vi-mode (stub: vimode/)

- define and extend api for script snippets

- make Frescobaldi api (using pydoc) browsable via the helpbrowser.
